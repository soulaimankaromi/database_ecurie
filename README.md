A small breeder of purebred horses plans to computerize its system to monitor the progress and careers of the horses coming from its stable.
• We want to be able to know what characterizes the different people participating in breeding, that is to say their name, first name, address and telephone number. We identify them
by a unique number. These people each have a very specific function (director, secretary, breeder, accountant, owner, maintenance, breeder-owner, etc.).
• All staff members are personally supervised by a superior (except the director who is at the top of the power ladder).
• We know the name, breed and color of each horse. He is assigned a unique number allowing him to be identified from birth. Each breed of horse has
specific characteristics such as its typical weight and typical height. We also want to follow the evolution of a horse’s growth. To do this, we note its weight and
its size every month. This makes it possible to construct growth curves specific to each animal and to be able to quickly detect possible anomalies by
in relation to the typical weight and size of his breed.
• We know the pedigree of each horse (that is to say we can find the characteristics of its parents), as well as its tattoo number (this number allows
to uniquely identify a horse, whatever its breeding, but is only assigned to a horse from its 2 months). Each horse is taken care of by a
specific breeder who trains it for competitions.
• Horses participate in competitions identified by their name and taking place every year. In addition to the number of participants at each meeting, we want to know the
place obtained by each horse of the breeding, which will allow statistics to be produced on the best winners.
• The horses have an owner whose name, first name, address and telephone number are known. Each owner is also monitored by a member of staff who
allows you to coordinate your horses' competitions. Each horse only has one owner at a given time but it can change several times and we wish
know this evolution, as well as the price that was set for each transaction.
